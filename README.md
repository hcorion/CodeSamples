# Code Samples

Here I've put various sample code from projects for the purpose of getting a job.

## ClimbingSystem
This folder has a part of the source code from my Final Project, The Elder, at VFS. The source code available here is the climbing component that would be attached to the player character.

The code in this repository is not in a redistributable or modifiable format unless otherwise stated.

## FullService

This folder has Unity source code for a overcooked-style game, written in an event-driven, state based architecture, with encapsulation as a key component.
